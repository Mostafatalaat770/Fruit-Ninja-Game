boso b2a ya shbb here's what we are gonna do:
in a nutshell i'll tell you how this game works
there is a time iterator called animations that's like a while loop that refreshes every said time (1 sec for example)
1-this iterator will call the getRandomThrowables and put them in the arrayList
2- once they are in the array list then they will be drawn on the canvas and we will deal with the gui part insha'llah
3- once the object leaves the screen it should be removed from the array list by searching in the list for objects with offscreen bool true and removing them

Mosta & Islam: ive uploaded the interfaces start working on the controller and throwables

swidan: finish the object's interface by completing the rendering methods and finish the canvas

seif: download scene builder  jFeniox lib and start working on the main menu ( preferably use animations and imageView) be crative fash5
